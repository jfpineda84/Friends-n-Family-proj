## Synopsis

**_Just did It!_** Midterm Project was our first Developer Group project during our Wyncode training. 

Its purpose consisted in selecting one of three options ranging from easy to difficulty. We chose med-high project implementing Imgur app clone with log-in capabilities, called _Just did It!_ which allows the users to `<create>` their most recent accomplishments or _Goals_ in their _Hall of Fame_ `<show>` page.
